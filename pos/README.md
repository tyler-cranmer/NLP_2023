# Assignment 3: HMM-based POS Tagger &amp; CRF-based NER Tagger

## Prerequisites

 - Install Anaconda

 - Create a new conda environment (in the Terminal):

    `conda create --name pya3 python=3.9`
    
 - Activate the environment:

     `conda activate pya3`

## Getting Started

  - Clone the repo, Enter the assignment directory. **Please do not fork the repo!!**
     
      ` git clone https://github.com/csci5832-f23/assignment_3.git `
      
      ` cd assignment_3 `
        
  - Install required libraries

     ` pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Tasks

- Task A: Parts of Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi Algorithm on Hindi Dataset (Total: 40 Points out of 100)
    - Implement missing code in [hhm.py](hmm.py)
    - Run the cells in [HMM POS.ipynb](HMM&#32;PoS.ipynb)
