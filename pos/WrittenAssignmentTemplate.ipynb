    "HMM PoS was to create the hidden Markov Model fit method and create the Viterbi table for finding the hidden states of the predicted sequence of words. This algorithm was used in Task 2 POS tagging of the Hindi dataset. The goal was to predict the POS tags of each word in the Hindi sentence. This was done by creating a dynamic table that kept tract of the max probability and state of a specific sequence. We also kept tract of the best path for each probability at any given time. \n",
